We begin with key features of User Story:

The must objective of user story is that it should quaify incremental output with some value associated.

A) User stories should qualify the criteria of three "C's":
      1) Card: Usually a sticky note, which summarises user story and at the back of it usually acceptance criteria or Definition of Done                (DOD) is clearly understood.
      
      2) Convesration: Convesration happeniing to refine user story amongst scrum team, PO and SM
      
      3) and Confirmation: PO must define the acceptance criteria or clear definition of done by user story
      
 B) User stories should qualify the criteria of "INVEST"
      I(Independent)- User story should be independent of other stories, we should try to break technical dependencies as often as    
                      possible.

      N-(Negotiable)- Story is not a contract and infact it should deliver desired value to customer, collaborative negaotiation between                         customer and team shoud happpen.

      V-(Valuable) -  The end point is user story should deliver a tangibe value and with specific reason.

      E-(Estimable) - Story should be estimable so that it can be easily prioritized. If story is too complex, it can be splitted.

      S-(Small) -     Stories should be small enough to be delivred in say small sprint of 2 week(s) and stories of maximum 3-4 days.

      T-(Testable)-   Every story should be testable to match "Definition of Done" or "Acceptance criteria", each member should agree that 
                      on verificattion to match definition of "done".
