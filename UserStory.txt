We begin with key features of User Story:

The must objective of user story is that it should quaify incremental output with some value associated.

User stories should qualify the criteria of three "C's":
      1) Card: Usually a sticky note, which summarises user story and at the back of it usually acceptance criteria or Definition of Done                (DOD) is clearly understood.
      
      2) Convesration: Convesration happeniing to refine user story amongst scrum team, PO and SM
      
      3) and Confirmation: PO must define the acceptance criteria or clear definition of done by user story
